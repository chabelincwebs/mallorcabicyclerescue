faq_title: "[TRANSLATE] Frequently Asked Questions"
faq:
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] Is it one policy per rider?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] Yes. One policy = one person + one specified bike. ID may be requested to prevent a group trying to cover everyone with one policy."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] Are rental or borrowed bikes covered?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] Yes—as long as it's the bike specified when purchasing (prevents group misuse)."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] Where will you take me?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] Your choice: nearest open bike shop, your accommodation, or your rental outlet."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] How long will I wait?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] Aim is 30–40 minutes; can be longer in remote areas (e.g., Port de Sa Calobra on very busy days). We have vehicles across the island and can bring in additional support."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] How many claims can I make?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] Once per policy per week per issue (e.g., 14-day cover includes two claims for the same issue). Different issues aren't capped, but abuse may result in cancellation and refund of the unused portion."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] Minimum distance from shop/hotel?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] At least 1 km from your accommodation or an open bike shop."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] When can I buy?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] At least 12 hours before you need it. We're rescue & recovery, not a taxi."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] Do you operate at night?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] No. From one hour after sunrise until sunset."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] Medical issues?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] Call an ambulance. We'll collect and look after your bike, but we are not medics."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] Off-road pickup?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] No. You must be on a road a standard (non-4×4) vehicle can drive on."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] Tandems, hand bikes, recumbents?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] Not currently covered—they don't fit in all vehicles."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] E-bikes?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] Covered for mechanical issues. A flat battery isn't a rescue reason; please manage charging—consider it a learning experience."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] Races/sportives?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] Not covered. We also cannot operate during the Mallorca 312 where there are road closures."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] Can I cancel?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] Yes—full refund as long as cover hasn't started."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] What info do I need to buy?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] Name, contact details, accommodation address, start date, and the bike details."
  - q: "[TRANSLATE] Can I change my bike during my stay?"
    a: "[TRANSLATE] Yes—email us at least 12 hours before and we'll update the policy."
