## 3. How we collect your personal data

Some of your personal data is provided to us by you directly, by filling in forms on our site or by sending us emails. We also might automatically collect certain data from you as you use our website by using cookies and similar technologies. (Please see our cookie policy for more details about this)

We may receive data from third parties such as analytics providers such as Google based outside the EU, advertising networks such as Facebook based outside the EU, such as search information providers such as Google based outside the EU, providers of technical, payment and delivery services, such as data brokers or aggregators.

## 4. Marketing communications

Our legal reason for processing your personal data is to send you marketing communications (either due to your consent or our legitimate interests – specifically to grow and improve our business).

According to the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, we may send you marketing communications from us if (i) you made a purchase or asked for information from us about our goods or services or (ii) you agreed to receive marketing communications and in each case you have not opted out of receiving such communications since. Under these regulations, if you are a limited company, we may send you marketing emails without your consent. However you can still opt out of receiving marketing emails from us at any time.

We will always get your consent before we share any of your personal data with any third party for their own marketing purpose. You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by emailing us at support@mallorcacycleshuttle.com at any time.

If you decide not to receive any marketing communications this does not mean that we will not receive your personal data provided as a result of other transactions, such as purchases.

## 5. Disclosure of your personal data

We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below:

- Service providers who provide IT, marketing and system administration services.
- Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers
- Government bodies that require us to report processing activities.
- Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.

Strictly, we require all third parties to whom we transfer your data to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our strict instructions.

## 6. International transfers

Any countries that are outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.

Some of our third party service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is in place:

We will only transfer your personal data to countries that the European Commission have approved as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data by. For countries where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. Or, if we use US-based providers that are part of EU-US Privacy Shield, we may transfer data to them, as they have equivalent safeguards in place.

If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.

## 7. Data Retention

We will only keep your personal data for as long as necessary in order to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To decide what the correct time is to store the data for, we always look at its amount, nature and sensitivity, potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if these can be achieved by other means and legal requirements.

We are required by law to keep basic information about our customers for tax purposes (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they stop being customers.

In a few circumstances we may anonymise your personal data for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## 8. Your legal rights

Under the data protection law you have rights over your own personal data, including the right to request access, correction, erasure, restriction, transfer, to object to processing, to portability of data and (where the lawful ground of processing is consent) to withdraw consent.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please email us at support@mallorcacycleshuttle.com.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive or refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you.

If you are unhappy with any aspect of how we collect and use your data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Authority – the Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (AEPD) – www.aepd.es We would be grateful if you would contact us first if you do have a complaint so that we can try to resolve it for you.
